We have learned that
normal distributions can be
seen as probability
distributions.
Mean = Median = Mode in a
normal distribution and
corresponds to the peak
value
Normal distribution is
symmetric around the peak
value.
68% of all data lie within
one standard deviation of
the mean
95% of all the data lie within
two standard deviation of
the mean
99% of all the data lie within
three standard deviation of
the mean
